Dear {{ user.name }}<br>
We have detected that You(or someone who has Your username) have failed to login recently from {{ ip }}<br>
Server usage policy allows to perform only {{ attempts_username }} attempts for one username and {{ attempts_ip }}
for one ip address<br>
Now You have to wait {{ login_delay }} before you'll be able to login<br>
Also consider resetting Your password, this will reset the delay<br>
Best regards,<br>
